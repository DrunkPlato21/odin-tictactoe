You can try it here: https://drunkplato21.github.io/odin-library/

A simple JavaScript/HTML/CSS tic tac toe project where you can play tic tac toe with a friend

I did this according to the rules of the Odin Project lesson: https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-tic-tac-toe

## **Features**

- Enter Names, and program will tell you the outcome
- restart the game and play again when the game is over
- built with factory functions and the module pattern


## **Development and Lessons Learned**

This tic tac toe project was developed using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.

This was a challenge for me, and it took me about 3 days to complete.

I learned an awful lot about how useful IIFE Modules are for organizing code and not getting lost while debugging. They are powerful tools that I'm looking forward to using them more often.
